# Assignment 8 â€“ Object State and Activity Modeling for Fitness Tracker

This repository contains UML **State Transition Diagrams** and **Activity Workflow Diagrams** created for the **NsukuSambo Fitness Tracker**. These models demonstrate object lifecycles, user workflows, and how they align with functional requirements, user stories, and Agile tasks.

## Contents

### State Transition Diagrams
These diagrams show how system objects evolve over time in response to events.

- `user_account.md`
- `fitness_profile.md`
- `activity_session.md`
- `recommendation.md`
- `achievement.md`
- `vital_stats.md`
- `device_sync.md`
- `analytics_report.md`

### Activity Workflow Diagrams
These diagrams model complex user/system interactions and workflows.

- `track_real_time_activity.md`
- `manage_profile.md`
- `receive_recommendations.md`
- `share_achievements.md`
- `monitor_vital_stats.md`
- `view_patient_progress.md`
- `sync_device_data.md`
- `generate_fitness_analytics.md`

## Integration with Prior Work

All diagrams are mapped to:

- **Functional Requirements** from Assignment 4  
- **Use Case Specifications** from Assignment 5  
- **User Stories** from Assignment 6  
- **Kanban Issues** from Assignment 7 (GitHub Board)

This ensures traceability between design artifacts and Agile development practices.
