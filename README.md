- `activity_session.md`
- `recommendation.md`
- `achievement.md`
- `vital_stats.md`
- `device_sync.md`
- `analytics_report.md`

#### Activity Workflow Diagrams
These diagrams model complex user/system interactions and workflows.

- `track_real_time_activity.md`
- `manage_profile.md`
- `receive_recommendations.md`
- `share_achievements.md`
- `monitor_vital_stats.md`
- `view_patient_progress.md`
- `sync_device_data.md`
- `generate_fitness_analytics.md`

#### Reflection
- `reflection_assignment8.md`

### Assignment 9 – Domain Model and Class Diagram

#### Domain Model
- `domain_model.md`: Describes all entities, attributes, methods, relationships, and business rules.

#### Class Diagram
- `class_diagram.md`: Mermaid.js class diagram representing the object-oriented structure of the system.

#### Reflection
- `reflection_assignment9.md`: Detailed explanation of challenges, design reasoning, and alignment with previous assignments.

## Integration with Prior Work

All diagrams and models are mapped to:

- **Functional Requirements** (Assignment 4)  
- **Use Case Specifications** (Assignment 5)  
- **User Stories** (Assignment 6)  
- **Kanban Board Tasks** (Assignment 7)

This ensures full traceability between system design and Agile planning artifacts.
