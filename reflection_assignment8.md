## Challenges with Granularity

Choosing the right level of detail was difficult. If too detailed, diagrams became cluttered and hard to follow. If too broad, they lost meaning. I learned to strike a balance by focusing on user interactions and system state changes directly tied to user stories and requirements.

## Agile Alignment

Linking diagrams to Kanban issues and user stories made the workflow modeling more purposeful. It ensured that I didn’t model unnecessary features and helped me stay aligned with actual sprint tasks.

## State vs Activity Diagrams

- *State Diagrams* were great for understanding object lifecycles and behavior (e.g., how an account moves from Registered → Active → Locked).
- *Activity Diagrams* clarified the steps needed for user workflows and highlighted decision points and alternative flows (e.g., syncing devices, tracking real-time data).

Both were useful and complementary in understanding system behavior.
